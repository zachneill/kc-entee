      <h1 id="chronicles-title">The Chronicles of IS&S</h1>
      <p id="tldr-button"><a href="#tldr-text">Click for TL;DR</a></p>
      <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">For many years I traversed the lands, searching
       listlessly for meaning. Through secondary school, my existence was nary a crumb
       in the slice of life. Perhaps there is no meaning at all, I thought to myself.
      I laid in bed on an early morning in May of 2019. It was Tuesday. As I trudged out of bed,
      my phone buzzed. Ah, it was my girlfriend. She thanked me for staying up
      all night comforting her and thankful that we've been together for two years, but she was tired and wanted to cry.
    Exactly 3 weeks later I would break up with her over SMS text for the first of
    two times. We'd get back together five days later. But that's not the point. </p>

    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">Something happened that May afternoon.
    After school, I received an email. Not my high school email. No, my Berea College
    email. This was before Berea emails became meaningless. I opened the email.</p>

    <h2 class="s2-h2" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">Congratulations! You have been selected to participate in
      the 2019 Berea Bridge program. </h2>

    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">Splendid. I forgot what Berea Bridge was, but when I remembered,
      I was anxious yet intrigued. What would rural Kentucky be like? Where would I work? I hope I make more money
      than the $8.50/hr I was getting at Dunkin’ (Yikes). I accepted the offer to Bridge. Weeks later, I received
      more information. I was informed that my assigned labor position was the Farm. Yes, the farm. </p>

    <h2 class="s2-h2" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">I did not want to work on a farm.</h2>

    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">I said I was disabled to my mom, who sent an email
      saying I was disabled to the lady in charge of disabled people, who then told the Bridge Director
      that I was disabled, who then moved me to IS&S. An IT Help Desk sounded disability-friendly. </p>

    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">Fast forward to Bridge. I met a number of trusted adversaries, such as Paige, Jhonny,
      and Matt. They were all great to be around. Matt was great to be around, but he smelled sometimes. My first shift at IS&S wasn’t
      really a shift, rather a name game moderated by this girl named Egypt. It would be years before I came to terms with Egypt.
      I was awful at the name game. I correctly guessed my immediate friends’ names. But I whiffed on Cecelia, Sierra, and Drevon,
      although I was close with guessing “Drew.” We’d played a game of chess, but I’d still thought his name was Drew. </p>

    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">At IS&S, I would go on to meet a generous fellow named Steve. He was my manager, and he
      was a cool guy. I messed up a few times, breaking protocol on many occasions. One shift, Paige, my future roommate John, and I
      belted out Take On Me. However, one of the employees, Chance, was on the phone. He told us to be quiet because we could be heard
      through the phone. I think one of us apologized. Ultimately, IS&S over the summer Bridge program was a lot of fun. After Bridge
      ended, my sense of belonging grew. Two days later, I would break up with my girlfriend over text for the 2nd
      and final time. Over Snapchat, this time. </p>

    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">It is now August of 2019. I thought I knew what I was doing,
      although I actually did not (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>). I could change passwords and issue loaners
      like the best of them. At my first labor meeting, I learned valuable information, more specifically who
      my student managers were. In Tier 1, there was Andrew, Ezra, and Blue. Andrew and Blue were cool because they
      were also from Pittsburgh. Blue was even cooler because they talked about their Kia Rio, which I learned was a car. </p>
    <h2 class="s2-h2" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">I believe <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/2018_Kia_Rio_%28YB%29_S_5-door_hatchback_%282018-08-06%29_01.jpg">
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this</span></a> is a Kia Rio.</h2>

    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">I was terrified of Ezra. I liked joking around and talking with my peers. But when Ezra
      was around, I never felt like I could do so because they could jump out of their seat and bite me. I inquired about Ezra a few
      times, most notably to this girl I met named Grace. We became friends, and she told me that Ezra was just hard to warm up to.
      Grace didn’t own a Kia Rio, but my nonsensical demeanor vibed well with whatever her demeanor was. </p>

    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">By second semester, I met another young lad named Taran. He always
      wore a beanie and told me why. Taran was old enough to drink. We would get along well. I became friends with
      everyone in the Tier 1 workplace except for Ezra and the sometimes-present Tier 2 student manager, Jessie.
      Ezra still scared me a lot. This began to change, however. The turning point was when I asked Ezra when they were
      going to graduate...</p>

    <h2 class="s2-h2" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">“Eventually,” they said. </h2>

    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">After Grace reassured me that Ezra wasn’t going to beat me up, my stance
      on them began to change for the better. Jessie scared me, but not as much. On one occasion, I stayed at work for
      fun for just over 5 hours straight. I told Taran this, who replied, “You’ve been clocked in for 5 hours? Clock
      out, you know that’s federally illegal.” Blue and Jessie overheard him and approached me simultaneously. It was frightening,
      like two sharks circling their prey. Blue said, “Yeah, you should probably leave,” with an amused grin. Jessie said,
      “Get out of here. Go.” The only grin present was chagrin. It would be a year before I lost my fear of Jessie.</p>

    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">I improved at my job and grew more confident in my abilities. So confident,
      I became fairly undisciplined. One time, Steve called me into his office. He asked me if I knew why he called me into
      his office. I said no. “I checked one of your tickets. It’s on ticket 420. You replied to the ticket, ‘Blaze It.’”
      I acknowledged that I indeed wrote that. I said I wouldn’t do it again. Thankfully, Steve didn’t check ticket 6969. That semester
      we left early because of the coronavirus, which eventually turned into a global pandemic. </p>

    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">While working at Dunkin’, I missed my IS&S companions. From March through August,
      I released an album to Spotify, iTunes, and other streaming services. One song barely missed the cut, and it was about IS&S.
      The song was called, “Why Am I Not Terminated?” It was an electropunk song. Here’s my other stuff, though. </p>
      <iframe id="spotify" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/3mbmorBOJpVAPlGFEZ2B6h"
      width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">I learned that Steve was taking over another job. Taking his place was this guy named
      Billy. Billy was chill. I’m under the impression that everyone currently approves of Billy. Over the first seven weeks, I
      worked 14 hours over the expected total. After being notified to work less, I went the following full 4-week pay period
      working just over 5 hours total. Much of this was because I was supposed to work in Phelps-Stokes for two weeks. I hated it
      there because of its depressing atmosphere. During the last week of the 2nd 7 weeks, I needed to log twenty-two hours.
      Because of this, I met Julie, who was behind on hours. We did 6-hours shifts together. I tried to order a pizza twice,
      although the first time I forgot to hit the order button. The second time was a success. I finished my 3rd semester in time. </p>
