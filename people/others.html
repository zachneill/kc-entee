      <div class="container-fluid padding-chronicles">
      <h1 id="chronicles-title" style="margin-bottom:5rem;">Other IS&S Crewmates and Impostors</h1>
      <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">While these people didn't get their own
      tab in the navigation bar, they still made it into the chronicles of IS&S.
      Ultimately, they too are important pieces of the metaphorical puzzle. </p>

      <h2 class="s2-h2" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">My ex</h2>
    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">You blocked my number, my Snapchat, my Instagram,
    my email, and my Facebook. Thanks for lowering my score on the <a href="http://ricepuritytest.com/">Rice Purity Test.</a> I hope
  your mom paid your tuition in full.</p>

      <h2 class="s2-h2" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">Jhonny and Paige</h2>
    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">Jhonny, you are dumb. It was nice
    breaking rules with you. I'm dumbfounded at how you haven't been kicked out, and that's okay.
    Paige, please come back. You were fun and also one of the first people I met
  at Bridge '19. I recall that first shift where you said, "I'm standing next to you because
  you're the only person I know." We miss you.</p>

    <h2 class="s2-h2" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">Egypt</h2>
    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">You still frighten me. Less each week.</p>

    <h2 class="s2-h2" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">Cecelia, Sierra, and Drevon</h2>
    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">RIP Cecelia. Sierra, you were cool. I'm glad you like
    my music. I'm releasing an EP this year. And Drevon, you've grown infinitely. You were also one of
    the first people I met in Bridge. I'm glad we got closer over quarantine. It's good you like RA duty.
  Drevon has yet to beat me in chess.</p>

    <h2 class="s2-h2" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">John</h2>
    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">I remember when you knew how to maintenance
      a loaner and I didn't. You were the best freshman year roommate. It sucks that you dropped
      out. When you finally packed your bags and left, that was one of the worst days at Berea.
    It's a good thing you live under 10 minutes down the road.</p>

    <h2 class="s2-h2" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">Chance and Andrew</h2>
    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">RIP Chance. You knew stuff, and you were easy
    to ask questions about. Andrew, everyone is glad to have you back, this time making actual
  money. A fellow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yinzer">yinzer</a> is a friend.</p>

    <h2 class="s2-h2" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">Jessie</h2>
    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">Before you graduated, you were in the Egypt zone.
    Then 2020 sophomore year hit, and it's the complete opposite. When a supervisor isn't around, you've become
  the first person I think of whom I could ask and receive the correct answer. </p>

  <h2 class="s2-h2" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">Julie</h2>
  <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">Julie, you're great. It was awesome essentially hanging out
  with you in the office during that last week of the semester. Thanks for giving me that Bang Energy drink. It was good. </p>

    <h2 class="s2-h2" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">Everyone else I forgot to mention</h2>
    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">Boo hoo. You didn't get name dropped. Allow me
    to play you a sad song. I'm not writing a bible, otherwise you probably would have gotten
  something. A footnote, at minimum. <span style="font-size: 70%;">Josh,</span>
  <span style="font-size: 60%;"> Aza,</span> <span style="font-size: 45%;">Pavel,</span>
  <span style="font-size: 35%;">James...</span></p>

    <p class="s2-p" style="text-indent: 40px">Crazy. This website progressed into a lot more
      than I had intended. Its entirety was going to be a parody and completely sarcastic.
      And this "Others" page wasn't supposed to be part of the site. However, I kept writing and memories
      began coming back to me. There were countless people who helped cultivate my experience at IS&S, and I just kept
      jotting down what I could recount. I stayed up overnight a few times to create and complete this website in six days.
      I might not be back after this upcoming semester. I'm applying for the student programming
   labor position, and I'll be in Costa Rica in the fall. There's a lot of uncertainty at the moment.
   For now, I should probably submit my schedule for the upcoming semester. Hope I don't get any 8am shifts.</p>

  <p class="others-text">Thank you,</p>
  <p class="others-text">Zach</p>
